OpenRequire
===========

It opens files that are required in Ruby. That's it.

OpenRequires provides one command: `:OpenRequire`, which opens a file
that is required on the current line.

Note: OpenRequire currently only works on `require_relative`.

## Usage

1. Go to a line with a `require_relative` statement
2. Use the `:OpenRequire` command
3. Profit!
